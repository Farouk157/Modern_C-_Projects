Problem: Library Management System
Design a Library Management System using Object-Oriented Programming concepts in C++.
The system should be able to handle books, users, and borrowing of books.

Requirements:

Book Class:

Attributes: title, author, ISBN, genre, availability.
Methods: Constructor, getter/setter methods.

User Class:

Attributes: name, id, books_borrowed.
Methods: Constructor, getter/setter methods, methods to borrow/return books.

Library Class:

Attributes: Collection of Book objects, collection of User objects.
Methods:
Add a new book to the library.
Remove a book from the library.
Register a new user.
Remove a user from the library.
Display all books.
Display all users.
Allow a user to borrow a book (if available).
Allow a user to return a book.
Search for a book by title, author, or genre.
Constraints:

A book can be borrowed by only one user at a time.
Implement proper error handling (e.g., book not found, user not found, book already borrowed).
Ensure that the library system manages memory efficiently (use smart pointers where appropriate).
Consider advanced OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation
